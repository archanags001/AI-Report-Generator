## ‚ö° Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. API Key Not Found or Invalid
**Issue:** You see an `AuthenticationError` or a similar message.  
**Cause:** The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in your `.env` file is missing, misspelled, or expired.  
**Solution:**
- Ensure the `.env` file is in the project‚Äôs root directory.  
- Verify the variable name is exactly `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.  
- Check the Google Cloud console to confirm the key is active and has Gemini API permissions.

### 2. Dependencies Not Installed
**Issue:** The app fails to start with `ImportError`.  
**Cause:** Required Python packages are missing.  
**Solution:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Report Generation Takes Too Long
**Issue:** Report generation is very slow.  
**Causes:** Large datasets, high model latency, or network issues.  
**Solutions:**  
- For very large CSVs, sample a smaller, representative subset.  
- Use a smaller, faster model for simple tasks.  
- Check your internet connection.

### 4. Inaccurate Information in Reports
**Issue:** Generated reports contain errors or ‚Äúhallucinations.‚Äù  
**Cause:** LLMs may produce inaccurate or fabricated content.  
**Solutions:**  
- **Manual Review:** Always verify generated content before use.  
- **Prompt Engineering:** Refine agent prompts to be clearer and more specific.  
- **Add Context:** Provide more domain-specific reference data to reduce reliance on generalized knowledge.
